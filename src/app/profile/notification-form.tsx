/**
 * Notification preferences.
 *
 * Split into WHAT (which events are worth telling you about) and HOW (which
 * channel), because those are genuinely separate choices — someone may want
 * every order update but only by email.
 *
 * Marketing defaults OFF and everything operational defaults on. That is the
 * honest default: the customer gave their address to be told their coffee is
 * ready, not to be sold to, and opt-out marketing is a dark pattern however
 * common it is.
 *
 * The copy below says plainly that channels are not wired up yet rather than
 * implying an SMS is coming. A preference screen that quietly does nothing is
 * worse than one that admits what it is.
