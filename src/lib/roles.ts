/**
 * Role logic, in one place.
 *
 * The rule the whole app follows: authority is CUMULATIVE. An admin can do
 * everything a staff member can, so counter work asks `isStaff()` — which is
 * true for both — and only the books ask `isAdmin()`.
 *
 * Nothing anywhere should compare `role === "staff"` directly. That test reads
 * as "is this person on the counter" but means "is this person NOT the owner",
 * and it is how an owner ends up locked out of their own order queue.
 *
 * `is_active` is folded into both checks for the same reason it is folded into
 * the SQL helpers: a deactivated account must lose access immediately, not at
 * its next login.
