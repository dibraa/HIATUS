 * Drink sizes and their price modifiers.

 * A menu item stores ONE price in `menu_items.price`; that price is the

 * shop keeps managing a single price per item in the admin UI.
 *
 * The Express order route re-derives every line price server-side so a client
 * cannot dictate what an order costs. The server and client must use the same
 * deltas or the cart will quote one total and the order will record another.
