/**
 * Keeps the queue current without anyone pressing anything.
 *
 * A polled `router.refresh()` rather than a realtime subscription.
 * The tradeoff is deliberate: a websocket would be a few seconds fresher, but
 * it also means a second data path with its own auth, its own reconnect
 * behaviour and its own way of being subtly wrong after a laptop lid closes.
 * `router.refresh()` re-runs the Server Component with the session it already
 * has, so there is exactly one way this page gets its data.
 *
 * Two things keep the polling honest:
 *
 *   - It stops while the tab is hidden. A till tablet left on the counter
 *     overnight should not spend the night querying.
 *   - It refreshes immediately on becoming visible again, so the first thing
 *     a returning barista sees is current rather than however stale the last
 *     poll left it.
