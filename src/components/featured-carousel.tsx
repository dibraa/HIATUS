/**
 * The pine feature panel — the comp's "Sips worth sharing".
 *
 * The comp drew this panel with two overlaps — the photograph riding up over
 * the heading's second line, and an espresso caption card straddling the
 * photo's edge — for depth from overlap rather than from shadow. Both have
 * since been taken out, deliberately: on real content each one covered
 * something that had to stay readable. The heading wraps to two lines at
 * `max-w-[9ch]`, so the photograph landed on "sharing" rather than grazing it,
 * and the caption card's 4rem straddle buried the right of the drink's own
 * photograph at wide sizes.
 *
 * What survives is the 2.5rem rise of the whole media row toward the heading,
 * which the heading now reserves space for (see the paired padding above). The
 * depth that is left comes from the matte, the colour break and that rise —
 * none of which cost a word or an image.
 *
 * The remaining offset is a CONTAINER query, not a viewport one. This panel was
 * also used inside a half-width hero column, and a viewport-keyed overlap put
 * the caption straight over the heading in the narrow case. Below the threshold
 * the same three pieces run in sequence.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT autoplaying. An auto-advancing carousel moves a control out
 * from under the pointer and fails WCAG 2.2.2 unless it ships pause controls;
 * a manual prev/next has none of that cost and loses nothing here.

            note on FeaturedCard's wrapper. The card rises by 2.5rem, so the
            heading reserves 2.5rem beneath itself for it to rise into. Reserved
            space rather than a guessed clearance is the whole point: the
            heading wraps to two lines at `max-w-[9ch]`, and a card pulled into
            unreserved space landed on the second line. Change one value and you
            must change the other, and the padding must stay the LARGER of the
            two: this face sets a line box tighter than its own glyphs, so the
            `p` and `g` of "Sips worth sharing" hang below the heading's
            measured bottom. Matching 2.5rem exactly put the photograph on those
            descenders; 4rem clears them with room to spare. Measured: the
            descenders hang 16px below the heading's box, so the reserve is the
            2.5rem rise plus that overshoot plus a little air. */}
