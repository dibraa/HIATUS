/**
 * A small labelled pill for a fact about a row: a role, a tender, whether the
 * money arrived, whether an order needs attention.
 *
 * The order-status badge stays its own component (`order-status-badge.tsx`)
 * because a lifecycle has an opinion about which state should shout — this one
 * is for facts that are merely different from each other, not ranked.
 *
 * Set in tracked mono caps, like every other label in the system, and cornered
 * as a soft rectangle rather than a pill so it sits in the same shape family
 * as the controls beside it.
 *
 * Colour is never the only cue. Every badge renders its label as text, so
 * removing all colour leaves the meaning intact (WCAG 1.4.1). The tints exist
 * to make a table scannable, not to carry the information.
