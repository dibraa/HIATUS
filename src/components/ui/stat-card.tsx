 * A single figure with its label — the unit the dashboards are built from.
 *
 * The value is the largest thing in the card and the label sits ABOVE it in
 * the DOM, so a screen reader reads "Revenue today, ₱4,820" rather than
 * announcing a bare number and then explaining it. Visually the label is still
 * the small text on top, so the reading order and the visual order agree.
 *
 * The figure is set in the mono UI face rather than the display face: Anton is
 * not tabular, and a dashboard number that changes width per digit makes a row
 * of cards jitter every time the page refreshes.
